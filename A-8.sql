Explanation: 
Products with product_id = 1 is ordered in February a total of (60 + 70) = 130.
Products with product_id = 2 is ordered in February a total of 80.
Products with product_id = 3 is ordered in February a total of (2 + 3) = 5.
Products with product_id = 4 was not ordered in February 2020.
Products with product_id = 5 is ordered in February a total of (50 + 50) = 100.

Solution:
select product_name,sum(unit) as unit
from Products p
left join Orders o on p.product_id = o.product_id
where order_date between '2020-02-01' and '2020-02-29'
group by p.product_id
Having unit >=100
