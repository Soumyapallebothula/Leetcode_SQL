it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
and Return the result table in any order.

Example 1:

Input: 
World table:
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-------------+------------+---------+
| name        | population | area    |
+-------------+------------+---------+
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
+-------------+------------+---------+

Solution : 
select name , population , area from World where area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;

Learning :
* The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
* The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:
* The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
* The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
* The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.
